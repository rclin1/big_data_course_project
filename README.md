# README - Code Description

The ETL code takes the input dataset; COVID-19 Daily Counts of Cases, Hospitalizations, and Deaths; and drops all of the columns except for the first 4 columns from the left. The output file, which will be named Clean_out.csv, should only have the columns DATE_OF_INTEREST, CASE_COUNT, HOSPITALIZED_COUNT, and DEATH_COUNT.

The profiling code counts all of the lines within the dataset and has two folders. The 'original' folder contin the code for profiling the original COVID-19 Daily Counts of Cases, Hospitalizations, and Deaths dataset. 'The 'clean' folder contains the code for profiling the clean data from the output of the ETL code. This process can be done on both the original dataset and the cleaned dataset outputted from the ETL code. The result for these code should be in the output file CountRecs_out.txt.
