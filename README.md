# README - Code Description

The ETL code cleans the input dataset; COVID-19 Daily Counts of Cases, Hospitalizations, and Deaths; and drops all of the columns except for the first 4 columns from the left. The output file should only have the columns DATE_OF_INTEREST, CASE_COUNT, HOSPITALIZED_COUNT, and DEATH_COUNT.

The profiling code counts all of the lines within the dataset. This process was done on both the original dataset and the cleaned dataset outputted from the ETL code.
